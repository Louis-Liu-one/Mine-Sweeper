## Some Skills to Play
**LEGEND**
 Sign|Meaning
----:|----
**4**|An opened cell
**F**|A cell which has been marked as a mine
**#**|A cell which can be opened
**!**|A cell which must be a mine

Don't know how to play the game? Here are some tips:

First, the showed number when you click a cell means the number of the mine around the cell you click. If the number is $n$, we call the opened cell an ``$n$-cell''. For example,
!|3|!
-|-|-
!|4|2
1|2|!

Second, if you know a cell is a mine, you can mark it by a single clicking. Besides, if you know a cell is not a mine, you can open it by a double clicking.
0|1|F
-|-|-
1|2|2
1|F|1

But how to know whether a cell is a mine? The following tips can be helpful:

Third, if $8 - n$ cells around an $n$-cell are opened, then the other $n$ cells around the $n$-cell are all mines.
0|1|!
-|-|-
1|2|2
1|!|1

For example, if 5 cells around a 3-cell are opened, then the other 3 cells around the 3-cell are all mines.
1|2|!
-|-|-
!|3|2
2|!|1

Fourth, if $n$ cells around an $n$-cell have been marked as a mine, then all the other $8 - n$ cells around the $n$-cell can be opened. For example, $n = 3$:
#|#|F
-|-|-
F|3|#
#|F|#

This law is the reverse of the Third Law.
#|F|F
-|-|-
F|5|F
#|F|#

These are the 4 basic skills to play the game. You can explore more laws and become an expert!
