Don't know how to play this game? Here are some tips:

First, the number which shows when you click a cell is the number of the mine around the cell you click. For example,
!|3|!
-|-|-
!|4|2
1|2|!

Second, if you know a cell is a mine by logical reasoning you can mark it by clicking. Besides, if you know a cell is not a mine by logical reasoning, you can open it by double clicking.
0|1|F
-|-|-
1|2|2
1|F|1

But how to reasoning logically?

Third, if $8 - n$ cells around an $n$-cell are opened, then the other $n$ cells around the $n$-cell are all mines.
0|1|!
-|-|-
1|2|2
1|!|1

For example, if 5 cells around a 3-cell are opened, then the other 3 cells around the 3-cell are all mines.
1|2|!
-|-|-
!|3|2
2|!|1

Fourth, if $n$ cells around an $n$-cell have been marked as a mine, then all the other $8 - n$ cells around the $n$-cell can be opened. For example, $n = 3$:
#|#|F
-|-|-
F|3|#
#|F|#

This principle is the reverse of the Third Law.
#|F|F
-|-|-
F|5|F
#|F|#

These are the four basic skill to play Mine Sweeper. You can explore more laws to become a mine sweeper expert!
